# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 7, 2025

This privacy policy applies to the Chrome extension **Dark Mode Switch** (“the extension”).

## Data Collection

This extension **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information**. It does not track browsing history, keystrokes, or any user activity.

## Permissions Usage

The extension requests the following permissions solely for its functionality:

* **`scripting`** – Used to inject CSS or small helper scripts that apply dark mode styles to web pages.
* **`activeTab`** – Grants temporary access to the active tab **only when the user clicks the extension icon**, so dark mode can be toggled on demand.
* **`host_permissions`** – Used if the user enables the "auto-apply" feature, allowing the extension to inject dark mode styles automatically across sites.

These permissions are used **exclusively for styling purposes**. No data is read, collected, or shared.

## Data Sharing

* We do **not** sell, trade, or transfer user data to third parties.
* We do **not** use data for advertising or analytics.
* All operations happen locally on the user’s device.

## Security

Since no personal data is collected, there is no risk of unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of user data from this extension.

## Changes to This Policy

If changes are made to this policy, the updated version will be published with a new effective date.
